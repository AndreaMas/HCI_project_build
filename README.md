## Goal of this project
The project focused on having a performant hand detection to enable an engaging gameplay, where the user is asked to catch eggs falling from the sky by simply placing its hand in front of the camera.

## App structure
The app is actually made up by two separate applications. A Pyhon application for hand detection and a Unity application for the rest. 

## How to run the game:
To run on windows:
- Open the PythonApp folder, and run the dist/main/main.exe executable. This enables hand tracking.
- Open the UnityApp folder and run the 3DHandTracking.exe executable. This launches the game.
